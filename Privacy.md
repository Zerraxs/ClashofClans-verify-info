# Privacy Policy ClashofClans-Verify

## Access to Data

Access to Data is only permitted to Bot's developers, and only in the scope required for the development, testing, and implementation of features for Bot. Data is not sold, provided to, or shared with any third party, except where required by law or a Terms of Service agreement.

## Storage of Data

Data is stored in a MySQL database. The database is secured to prevent external access, however no guarantee is provided and the Bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application.

## Data collected

we store the discord id of the server, the id of paired users (discord), the id of the clan from ClashofClans and the id of the player in ClashofClans
All of this information is publicly available on Discord as well as ClashofClans, but the bot itself does not share it in any way,
the one-time code for account verification from ClashofClans changes automatically after use and is only used for verification, so it cannot be used a second time and is not saved in any way

# SSL

To protect security, all data is sent via http*s*.
